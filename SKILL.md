# Reserve with Google

Automate restaurant reservations and business bookings through Google Maps using browser automation.

## Prerequisites

- `agent-browser` installed: `npm install -g agent-browser`
- Internet access
- Optional: Pre-authenticated Google profile (see Profile Setup below)

## Before Starting

Collect from the user:
1. **Search query** — what/where to book (e.g., "Italian restaurants in downtown Chicago")
2. **Date** — desired reservation date
3. **Time** — preferred time
4. **Party size** — number of guests (restaurants)
5. **Name** — for the reservation
6. **Phone** — contact number
7. **Email** — confirmation email
8. **Special requests** — optional (e.g., "window seat", "high chair needed")

## Profile Setup (One-Time)

For best results, set up a persistent browser profile with a logged-in Google account:

```bash
agent-browser --headed --profile ~/.reservegoogle open "https://accounts.google.com"
```

The user logs in manually once. The profile persists across sessions. If no profile exists, fall back to guest mode.

Alternative: Use state save/load for portable auth:

```bash
# After logging in:
agent-browser state save ~/.reservegoogle-auth.json

# In future sessions:
agent-browser state load ~/.reservegoogle-auth.json
agent-browser open "https://www.google.com/maps"
```

## Core Workflow

**CRITICAL**: Always use `snapshot` before every interaction. Refs change on every page update. Never hardcode element references.

### Step 1: Open Google Maps & Search

```bash
agent-browser --profile ~/.reservegoogle open "https://www.google.com/maps"
agent-browser snapshot -i
```

Find the search box in the snapshot, then:

```bash
agent-browser fill @<searchBoxRef> "<user's search query>"
agent-browser press Enter
agent-browser wait --load networkidle
agent-browser snapshot -i
```

Parse the results list. Present places to the user with indicators of which ones have booking available (look for "Reserve a table", "Book online", or similar text in results).

### Step 2: Select a Place

After user picks a place:

```bash
agent-browser click @<resultRef>
agent-browser wait --load networkidle
agent-browser snapshot -i
```

Look for booking buttons in the snapshot. Common text patterns:
- "Reserve a table"
- "Book online"
- "Book an appointment"
- "Schedule"
- "Find a table"

If NO booking button found: inform the user this place doesn't support online booking. Suggest nearby alternatives from the search results.

### Step 3: Initiate Booking

```bash
agent-browser click @<bookButtonRef>
agent-browser wait --load networkidle
```

Detect what happened:

**Check URL** with `agent-browser get url`:
- Still on `google.com/maps` → Google-native widget or iframe
- `opentable.com` → OpenTable flow (see [THIRD-PARTY-PROVIDERS.md](references/THIRD-PARTY-PROVIDERS.md))
- `resy.com` → Resy flow
- `vagaro.com` → Vagaro flow
- `yelp.com/reservations` → Yelp flow
- `toasttab.com` → Toast flow
- Other domain → Generic 3rd-party flow

**Check for iframes**: If the booking widget loaded in an iframe:
```bash
agent-browser snapshot -i
```
If you see an iframe element in the snapshot, identify its CSS selector (e.g., `id` or `name` attribute), then switch into it:
```bash
agent-browser frame "#booking-iframe"
agent-browser snapshot -i
```
To return to the main frame after interacting with the iframe:
```bash
agent-browser frame main
```

### Step 4: Select Date, Time & Party Size

Take a snapshot to identify the booking form elements:

```bash
agent-browser snapshot -i
```

For restaurants, look for:
- **Date picker**: calendar widget or date dropdown
- **Time slots**: buttons or dropdown with available times
- **Party size**: number input, dropdown, or +/- buttons

Fill in the user's preferences:

```bash
agent-browser click @<datePickerRef>
# Navigate to correct date in calendar
agent-browser click @<targetDateRef>
agent-browser click @<timeSlotRef>
agent-browser fill @<partySizeRef> "<count>"
```

If the preferred time is unavailable, snapshot again and present available alternatives to the user.

### Step 5: Fill Personal Information

```bash
agent-browser snapshot -i
agent-browser fill @<nameFieldRef> "<user's name>"
agent-browser fill @<phoneFieldRef> "<user's phone>"
agent-browser fill @<emailFieldRef> "<user's email>"
```

If there's a special requests field:
```bash
agent-browser fill @<specialRequestsRef> "<user's requests>"
```

Snapshot to verify all fields are populated correctly.

### Step 6: Confirm Before Submitting

**MANDATORY**: Before clicking the final booking button, present the user with a summary:

```
Booking Summary:
- Place: [restaurant name]
- Date: [date]
- Time: [time]
- Party size: [count]
- Name: [name]
- Special requests: [if any]

Confirm this booking?
```

Only proceed after user confirms.

### Step 7: Complete Booking

```bash
agent-browser click @<confirmButtonRef>
agent-browser wait --load networkidle
agent-browser snapshot -i
```

Look for confirmation indicators:
- "Reservation confirmed"
- "Booking confirmed"
- Confirmation number/code
- "You're all set"

Take a screenshot for the user's records:
```bash
agent-browser screenshot confirmation.png
```

Report to the user:
- Confirmation status
- Confirmation number (if shown)
- Date/time/party size confirmed
- Any special instructions from the restaurant

## Error Handling

### CAPTCHA Detected
Inform the user: "Google is showing a CAPTCHA. Please complete it manually." Wait for user to resolve, then continue.

### Slot No Longer Available
Re-snapshot, show remaining available slots, ask user to pick another.

### Payment Required
Inform the user: "This booking requires payment. I cannot enter payment details. Please complete payment manually." Take a screenshot showing the payment page.

### No Availability
Suggest: different date/time, nearby similar restaurants, or trying again later.

### Multiple Booking Options
If the place offers multiple booking types (dine-in, takeout, waitlist), ask the user which one before proceeding.

## Session Management

Use `--session` for parallel searches:
```bash
agent-browser --session search1 --profile ~/.reservegoogle open "https://www.google.com/maps"
```
